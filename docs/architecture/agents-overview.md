## Overview

This repository uses **Copilot Chat Agents** to accelerate development and operations. These are conversational agents in your IDE that help you plan, code, configure, and deploy.

---

## Copilot Chat Agents

These agents live in GitHub Copilot (Chat). Use them to accelerate your daily tasks.

| Agent | Specialized Role | When to use? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@onboarding` | **The Guide** | "I just forked this repo, what do I do?" |
| `@architect` | Solution Design | "How should I design a new microservice?" |
| `@platform` | IDP & Templates | "I want to create a new Golden Path." |
| `@terraform` | IaC & Azure | "Help me configure the AKS module." |
| `@reviewer` | Code Quality | "Review my PR for security issues." |
| `@devops` | CI/CD Pipelines | "Optimize this GitHub Actions workflow." |
| `@security` | Compliance | "Am I following the security baseline?" |
| `@sre` | Observability | "How do I debug this production error?" |
| `@test` | Testing & QA | "Write a unit test for this function." |
| `@docs` | Documentation | "Generate a Mermaid diagram for this flow." |
| `@deploy` | Deployment & Release | "Deploy this service to staging environment." |

### How to use

In VS Code or GitHub.com, type `@agent-name` in the Copilot Chat window.

> **Example:** `@onboarding help me check if I have all prerequisites installed.`

## Workflow Patterns

### The "Fork-to-Deploy" Journey

1. **Start:** User forks repo.
2. **Guide:** User asks `@onboarding`: "Help me get started".
3. **Config:** `@onboarding` helps user create `.tfvars`.
4. **Deploy:** User runs `./scripts/platform-bootstrap.sh --environment dev`.
5. **Action:** Terraform provisions Azure infrastructure.
6. **Result:** Foundation layer is live.

### New Feature Implementation

1. `@architect` - Design and plan (Create ADR).
2. `@docs` - Document requirements and diagrams.
3. `@test` - Write TDD test cases.
4. `@terraform` / `@platform` - Implement Infrastructure / Code.
5. `@devops` - Configure Pipeline.
6. `@reviewer` - Final Code & Security Review.
7. **Merge** -> Triggers CI/CD.

## Agent Directories

- **Copilot Agents:** Definitions located in [`.github/agents/`](../../.github/agents/).
- **Skills:** Reusable tools located in [`.github/skills/`](../../.github/skills/).

## Best Practices

1. **One Agent, One Task:** Don't ask `@terraform` to design a UI. Use `@architect` or `@platform`.
2. **Use Handoffs:** Agents are aware of each other. If `@onboarding` sees you need complex design help, it will refer you to `@architect`.
3. **Trust but Verify:** Always review the code generated by Copilot agents before committing.
4. **Security First:** Never put real secrets in chat. Use Key Vault references.
