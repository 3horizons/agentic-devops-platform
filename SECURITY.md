## Security Standards

The Three Horizons Accelerator follows enterprise security best practices:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Workload Identity**: All AKS workloads use Azure Workload Identity
- **Managed Identity**: All Azure services use Managed Identity
- **No Service Principal Secrets**: Service principal keys are prohibited
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control with least privilege principle
- **MFA**: Multi-factor authentication required for all human accounts

### Network Security
- **Private Endpoints**: All PaaS services use private endpoints
- **NSG**: Network Security Groups with deny-by-default rules
- **Azure Firewall**: Egress filtering for production environments
- **DDoS Protection**: Enabled for production workloads
- **TLS 1.3**: Minimum TLS version for all communications

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted using Azure managed keys
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network traffic
- **Key Vault**: All secrets stored in Azure Key Vault
- **Data Classification**: Support for LGPD, SOC 2, PCI-DSS compliance

### Container Security
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use distroless or minimal base images
- **Non-Root**: All containers run as non-root user
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: Root filesystem is read-only
- **Pod Security Standards**: Restricted policy enforced
- **Image Scanning**: All images scanned before deployment

### CI/CD Security
- **Secret Scanning**: Gitleaks runs on every push
- **Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot and Trivy for vulnerability detection
- **SAST**: Static analysis on all code changes
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: tfsec for Terraform code
- **Signed Commits**: GPG-signed commits recommended

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@your-organization.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Critical | Immediate exploitation risk | RCE, credential exposure, data breach |
| High | Significant risk | Privilege escalation, authentication bypass |
| Medium | Moderate risk | Information disclosure, SSRF |
| Low | Minor risk | Verbose errors, minor misconfigurations |
